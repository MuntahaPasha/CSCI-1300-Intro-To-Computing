/*Helper Function: Remove Punctuation
* This function does exactly what it sounds like. It removes punctuation from a given line.
* It takes in a line, iterates through the length of the line, makes each character lowercase first, then uses each character in the check punctuation function
* to compare if it's a mark or not. If check punctuation is true, and there is punctuation, we need to test a bunch of other criteria.
* We are removing punctuation at the end and beginning of words, but not from in between words. Meaning "How're you?!" would be "how're you", and the apostrophe
* between how and re would remain.
* So, in order to test, we need to see if the word has a space before it, or a space after it.
* We begin by checking each end of the line, if it has punctuation, and then each word individually, which we do using a boolean method.
* Booleans will return true or false depending on if there's a space or not.
* At the end, we will return the line having no punctuation in it anymore.

* Tally words is supposed to take in a sentence, and it is supposed to read it in, and store the words in one array called wording array.
* It is also supposed to store the count of how many times that word appeared in the sentence in another counting array.
* For example, if you had "The bat the cat" it will store [the, bat, cat] in wording and corresponding counting would be [2, 1, 1] because "the" showed up twice.
* In order to properly adjust the sentence to that, you must first strip it of punctuation by calling remove punctuation on it, and then you need to split it.
* As usual, splitting the sentence will return the size, and you need that to find out how big the input sentence is.
* You iterate through a for loop, and you use the check words function to see if the value in your temp array, where all your words have now been stored, comes
* out to be true. If it does, you need to find that position in the count array, using the temp variable that holds the position, and increment it at the same
* place for the count. That way wording and counting arrays correspond exactly.
* We also need to increment our index's.
