/* Sum Array Algorithm:
* Function called sumArray, which adds up all the numbers in an array and returns a floating point value.
* You can find this sum by setting up a float variable called sum, which will store the sum value each time you iterate through the index.
* Sum starts out at 0, but then you add the number to sum at the position of the index where we initially start, so zero.
* That value gets stored in sum, and the process repeats now for the next value in the index, that plus the initial sum now makes the new sum.

/* Search function Algorithm:
* This function looks for a given target value, an integer, in a long array.
* Using a nested loop, an if inside a for, you iterate through the index with the for loop.
* The if loop is used to see if the index position in the array holds the target value. If so, return that position.
*/

/* Calculate Difference Algorithm:
* In order to calculate the difference of two values in different arrays and square it, you know you'll need an index, and a pow.
* To start off you'll make a float variable, matching our data type, to hold the value of the smaller function inside.
* Set difference equal to zero, then make your for loop, and call your difference variable inside it to calculate the difference squared.
* It'll take the same index position in array a, and array b, and minus those, then square them, all inside a pow.
* Difference will hold the result, and once the loop is exited, you will return the value of difference.
*/

    for(int i=0; i<size; i++) //for loop that iterates through index
    {
        difference=difference + pow((a[i]-b[i]),2); //pow function, base is the index position of a minus same index position of b, then the exponent is 2.
    }
    return difference; //return the variable which you found in the for loop.
}

/* Sort Array Algorithm:
* Function called sortArray, which, using a bubble sort, iterates through the array.
* You can do this by checking if the position at index is greater than the position of the index after that, if so, switch the two.
* If the position at index is not greater than the one next to it, then leave it.
* There will be two index's, the second one is most important in the sense that second index that is meant to convey how far along we have moved. For example,
  if the array length was seven, seven minus zero, which is the index position, minus 1, tells you that you have sorted one number, now you have 6 more to sort.
* Keep going through index and swapping numbers accordingly.

        {
            if(unsortedArray[j] > unsortedArray[j+1]) //if the value in the index is greater than the value next to it...
            {
            float positionarray = unsortedArray[j+1]; //then swap the first and second numbers by holding the second number in a new variable
            unsortedArray[j+1]= unsortedArray[j]; //store the value of the first value now in the value next to it
            unsortedArray[j]= positionarray; //and store the variable you stored the second value in equal to the first value place holder
            }
        }

/* Copy Array Algorithm:
* This takes two parameters, a source, and a destination. The source array provides the inputs needed to put into the destination array.
* You copy the value from source array and index position, and then the index at that position in destination array value becomes that number.
* So now, destination at that index should equal the source at that index in value.

{
    for(int index=0; index<size; index++) //iterate through index

/* Convert Function Algorithm:
* This function coverts a number from an array to a string in the next array.
* Based on what number is present in the first array, there is a corresponding string value that will be entered in the position of the other array.
* It goes through the index of the first, according to the value in each index position, it then makes that a string in the position of the second array.
* It then goes through the index, at each position, searching for those certain integer values to convert to strings in the second array, and if it sees a
  number other than the ones provided, it will give back "INVALID"

/*Float find Median function algorithm
* Frst you are copying the original array over, using the copy function that you wrote, so that you can store the array into a variable that you have control
* over, and so that you don't mess with the original array.
* After that, you want to call your sorting function to sort the array so that we can find the median.
* Once the array has been copied, and sorted, you write out the median function. If it's odd, you know the median is the position of the size/2.
* However, if it's an even array, you have to calculate the average between two middle numbers, so it requires more steps. You divide, and then average.
* The function will then return you the middle value.
