 *To find days, you would do s/86,400
 *You will get a remainder, and you take that away from the total number of seconds
 *Then, to find the number of hours you would do s/3600
  *You take the remainder away from the total number of seconds again
 *To find minutes you would do s/60
 *Your remainder would then be the number of seconds leftover
 *Final function output should be expressed as cout of days, hours, minutes,
