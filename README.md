# CSCI-1300-Intro-To-Computing
A repository full of my work from Intro to Computing, CSCI 1300 at CU Boulder. Fall 2017.

DISCLAIMER: Please do not use work in dihonest way! This serves as a place to show the work I have completed in the past.

Special Mentions:
Ecosystem Project was a simulation I built that prompted users to develop an awareness about the fragility of ecosystems by designing a small game given the coding I learned over the course of the semester. Definitely a project I am proud of!
