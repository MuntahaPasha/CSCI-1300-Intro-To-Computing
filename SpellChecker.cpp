* Firstly, you will receive a file with two words per line. A misspelled word, and it's corrected counterpart.
* You are going to read in that file's data, and check if the file opens. If it doesn't let us know and return false.
* If it does, then we want to create a temporary array that only holds two things at a time. The misspelled word, and the corrected word.
* We want to get each line from the file, we want to split it at the tab character, and we want to store each value into this temp array with size two.
* We are then storing each of the two values in our temp array to the corresponding row and columnn in the word array.
* You want to increment the row and column, each time you go on, so you're not overriding any information.
* You also want to set the column number to 0 each time you're you're starting from the same column, and not adding onto column numbers.
* At the end of this, corrected words should be filled into a 2D array that now holds a misspelled word in the first column, and it's corrected word in the second.

* This function does exactly what it sounds like. It removes punctuation from a given line.
* It takes in a line, iterates through the length of the line, makes each character lowercase first, then uses each character in the check punctuation function
* to compare if it's a mark or not. If check punctuation is true, and there is punctuation, we need to test a bunch of other criteria.
* We are removing punctuation at the end and beginning of words, but not from in between words. Meaning "How're you?!" would be "how're you", and the apostrophe
* between how and re would remain.
* So, in order to test, we need to see if the word has a space before it, or a space after it.
* We begin by checking each end of the line, if it has punctuation, and then each word individually, which we do using a boolean method.
* Booleans will return true or false depending on if there's a space or not.
* At the end, we will return the line having no punctuation in it anymore.

/*Algorithm: Repair Function
* You'll first want to declare out the variables you'll be using. I decided to use a temporary array that holds no more than a few words at a time.
* I set it's size to 200 just to be safe, but it's really only used for holding sentences.
* You'll want a repaired sentence string, that will hold the repaired sentence at the end.
* I put the string that they feed into the function into my remove punctuation function that I call here.
* The string variable new sentence now holds the line without punctuation.
* You are now going to want to split the line into words and store them into a temporary array. It counts how many words it splits so you also have the size.
* So for example...If you had "Hello!! I'm Joe!" new sentence holds "hello i'm joe", and then the temp array holds [hello, i'm, joe]
* You are then going to call your check valid word function to check each word in the array which the size was told by the split function.
* If that valid word exists in the valid words array, then add it to the repaired string as it is. That means this is an acceptable word.
* If, however, you don't find it in valid words array, you then want to find if it has a corrected word corresponding to it.
* You will call the helper function for it, called checkValidWord, and if it returns true, that means it's in the word Array somewhere, and we use the position,
* which check valid words gives us, and we find the position corresponding in the correct words, we take that word and add it to the repaired sentence now.
* If it's not in valid words, or in corrected words, then you simply put a start an end marker on it to indicate it was not found in either arrays and has no
* corresponding values.
* You then need to add a space everytime you iterate so the words aren't mashed together.
* When the loop ends and you have iterated through every word in the line, the function will return you your corrected sentence.
