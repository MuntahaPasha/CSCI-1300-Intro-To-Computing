/*Fill Array Algorithm:
* First you need to open the file, and skip over the header using a getline to remove the header.

* Now you have an index that's less than 5, the max number of columns it can be is 5.
* It's going to take the values from file, after having split the string, and store them into a temporary array as floats.
* Since your data came in as a string, you need to convert your string to a float, using stof.
* Close your file after that's done.
